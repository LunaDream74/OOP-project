This is a small game of tetris that we made using entirely C++ programming language and raylib library. The game uses various raylib functions for graphics, input handling, and audio that can be played on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. If you want to use this program, please download the raylib library first(follows the guide on how to download raylib in the "Video Tutorial on how to download raylib" section).

We've added several new features to the original like: a game menu screen, added difficulty as you level up and some custom sound effects. And also fixed some minor issues with the original game.
